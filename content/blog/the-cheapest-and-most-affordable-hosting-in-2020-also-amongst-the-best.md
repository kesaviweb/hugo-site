When purchasing a web hosting server for the first time (year), you do not have to think much; as most hosting providers offer hefty discounts on the first year subscription or first few years of subscriptions. Every hosting provider claims to be offering the most affordable hosting plans with huge discounts applied to the normal pricing. But when it comes to renewing your hosting server, you are often out again in search of another budget hosting plan. This approach is fine but it comes with the hassle of migrating your websites, email accounts, databases to a new server. Though most hosting service providers offer free server migrations with certain plans, it is still a daunting task to go through the same process year after year.

Is there a server that has a static fee?
----------------------------------------

Fortunately, yes there is. [Interserver](https://www.interserver.net/webhosting/?id=494120) offers plans starting @ $5/month that only drop to $4 with a subscription of 3 years. They guarantee a price lock that ensures your hosting cost will never increase in the future.

They have a wide variety of [shared hosting](https://www.interserver.net/webhosting/?id=494120), [VPS hosting](https://www.interserver.net/vps/?id=494120), and [dedicated hosting](https://www.interserver.net/r/494120) plans that one can choose from. Their prices are extremely competitive when compared to most hosting service providers.

Interserver.net provides much more value for the money you pay by allocating a generous amount of resources to your account. The screenshot below shows the resources they provide for a $5/month shared hosting account.

With physical memory of 3GB, 30 Entry processes, and 100 processes quota, you are sure to not run out of resources even on the busiest day on your websites. No other host offers such generous quota in this costing.

Above all, the renewal prices at interserver.net remain same every time you renew, whereas all other hosting providers including the two I have mentioned in my article charge 3-4 times renewal prices second year on wards.

### Are they as good as a2hosting & siteground?

Having used **Siteground** hosting services in the past and being an **a2hosting** user currently, I can honestly tell you my experience with interserver.net when compared to those two heavyweights in the hosting arena.

While you won't spot a difference in your website hosting experience much, all three provide Cpanel hosting which is easy to handle. All hosting providers boast of above 99% uptime and unless you stand to lose millions for a fraction of a second due to downtime, it doesn't matter much. (You would be going to a dedicated server anyways for that scale of business). Remember, this article is about the cheapest shared hosting provider.

I found a few useful articles comparing these hosting services which are pretty good.

### [Interserver](https://www.interserver.net/r/494120) is the Winner

When it comes to affordable shared hosting, Interserver is the clear winner. Even the two articles above don't dispute the fact that when it comes to price & value Interserver provides the best bargain. Even on other parameters of performance, it goes neck-to-neck with leading hosting providers. A rating of 4.7 out of 5 is proof of its stellar hosting services.

### Will interserver leave all other hosting services behind?

With its affordable planning and forever improving customer support, yes it can. Can't comment on how soon, but it certainly holds the potential to do so.

When comparing after sales support with Siteground I would keep it interserver at 7 while Siteground at 10 out of 10. Support at interserver does take time and at times they take longer to resolve certain queries, whereas Siteground support is probably the best in hosting space.

What we need to remember here is that Siteground charges hefty prices for its hosting services and also spends a whole lot of money on its support system which makes it the first choice for large enterprises. Interserver is constantly improving its support system and with a little more effort they can possibly pip Siteground in years to come.

### Final verdict

If your pockets are heavy with money and excellent support is your only priority, you should choose Siteground without second thoughts. But if you are looking to start a few websites and are on a tight budget, there is no alternative to interserver. With unmatched price lock on renewal and an above-average after-sales support team, they are the best value for your hard-earned money.
