      <description>Create FREE JAMstack blog with Draftbox, Ghost CMS &amp;amp; Netlify CDN
I had been running my blog ontraveldiary.com on WordPress for a year, and I must say WordPress is an amazing platform and it is evolving with time to provide better features for bloggers. But at times it becomes an overkill for a simple blogger like me. Trying my way around a number of plugins to achieve a certain goal, I always felt that it would have been better if there was one CMS which didnâ€™t involve so much technical knowledge (trust me you need more than enough technical no-how to get around WordPress, though it is a code free platform for a larger part).</description>
